    Usage: ${FUNCNAME[0]} [opts] archive.zip

    Notes

    - Use -v for maximum verbosity.
    - This uses the -m option (medium verbosity), which includes the output of
      -h (headers) and -t (totals). It also adds -z to print the archive
      comment, if any.
    - The only difference with -s (short) output, is that is omits the
      compression ratio column, and with -l (long) is that is prints the
      compressed size instead of ratio.

zipit() (
    docstr="Move files or directory trees to a zip archive.

    This is a wrapper function for quickly adding files to a zip archive,
    and then removing the source files to simulate a move operation.
    It uses reasonable defaults for unix-like operating systems, and takes
    a list of files to exclude from ~/.config/zip/zip_xlist, and a list of
    file types to add without compression from ~/.config/zip/zip_nlist.

    Usage

        $FUNCNAME [options] [archive[.zip]] path1 [path2 ...]

    If only 1 non-option argument is issued, $FUNCNAME will create an archive
    in the same directory and named the same way as the input path, with
    a .zip file extension added.

	Optional arguments to zip may be added, as usual (see the man page).

	Expand zip archives using e.g. \`unzip arch1.zip\`. Unzip to stdout with
	'-p' (pipe).

	Examples

	- zip in-place with max compression:

	    zipit -9 file.txt

	Zip Command Notes

    - The form of a zip command is
      zip [opts] zipfile file(s)

    - The current default options for the zip command are in ZIPOPT:
      '${ZIPOPT}'

    - Pattern matching by zip is similar to globs, using the special chars
      ?, *, , and [...]. Files beginning with '.' are not treated specially.

    - Patterns provided to -R, -i, and -x are compared against archive paths
      after the filesystem scan. That is, the patterns match paths as if they're
      strings, and * matches across the '/' character just like any other, unless
      the -ws option is used. A pattern such as '*/bar' matches files only, unless
      it ends with a path separator ('/'). Even using '-x */bar/' will fail to
      exclude a directory called bar if files within bar are included in the
      archive. To match (e.g. exclude) a directory and all of its contents, a path
      like '*/bar/*' is necessary (or '**/bar/**' when using -ws). Escape or quote
      wildcard patterns given on the command line to avoid their interpretation by
      the shell.

    Important options:
     -r : Recurse paths, to include files under any directories provided in the
          arguments. Files included may be tweaked using -x and -i.
     -R : Scan the directory tree starting at the current directory for files
          matching the provided pattern(s). In this case, only patterns are
          provided, rather than file paths to include. It is invalid to specify
          both -r and -R.
     -x : exclude file patterns from archive (literal '@' terminates list).
     -i : include only files matching the pattern.
     -n : do not use compression on listed files.
          per the man page, zip  does not compress files with the following extensions:
          .Z:.zip:.zoo:.arc:.lzh:.arj
          in ~/.config/zip/zip_nlist, the list of files is extended.
     -o : make archive mtime same as newest file in the archive.
    -ws : require ** to match across directory boundaries.
     -y : archive symlinks as symlinks.
