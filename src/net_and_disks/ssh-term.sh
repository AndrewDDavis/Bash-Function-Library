        Usage: ssh-term [options] user@host

        Note on SSH command and shell logins:

          - When running \`ssh host\`, sshd runs \`bash\` as a login shell.

          - When running \`ssh host cmd\`, sshd runs \`bash -c cmd\`, not as a login shell
            see [this QA for more detail](https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/744263/85414).

          - Running \`exec -l ...\` replaces the non-login shell with a login shell, which
            is preceeded by '-' in \$0, in the insane method that shells have for \"knowing\"
            they're a login shell. Thus, running \`shopt -p | grep login\` will show that
            login is set, and the shell sources /etc/profile and ~/.profile.

          - OTOH, setting BASH_ARGV0 in the command call had the desired effect on \$0, but
            the profile rc files were not read, and shopt shows it's not a login shell.

          - In any case, the MOTD does not display in Ubuntu, but could be replicated by
            adding \`run-parts /etc/update-motd.d/\` before the bash call. Or even just
            replicating the header by sourcing /etc/lsb-release and then running:
            printf \"Welcome to %s (%s %s %s)\\n\" \\
                \"\$DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION\" \"\$( uname -o )\" \"\$( uname -r )\" \"\$( uname -m )\"

          - This indicates that sshd, on user authentication, does more than just drop
            the user into a shell. This may have to do with PAM authentication modules. See
            the login process section of \`man sshd\` for details.
