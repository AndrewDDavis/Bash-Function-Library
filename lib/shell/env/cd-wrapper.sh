        Usage

          cd-wrapper [-L|-P] [path]
          cd-wrapper (+|-)N

        This function is meant to be aliased as 'cd' to combine the best features of
        the cd and pushd built-in commands:

          - When changing directories, all options for 'cd' are allowed. In particular,
            the -L and -P flags may be used to control how the path is interpreted.

          - However, the pushd command is ultimately used to change the current working
            directory (CWD), so that the directory stack is kept up-to-date.

          - The 'cd -' shorthand is allowed, to return to the previous working
            directory.

          - Using 'cd +N' is allowed, which acts like 'pushd +N' to change to a
            directory from the stack.

        Background Notes

          - Unlike when using pushd, the cd built-in command only changes top element
            of the directory stack, visible through the PWD variable, or the command
            'dirs +0'. The cd command does track the last PWD value using OLDPWD, which
            is available using the 'cd -' command.

          - This function supports the -L and -P options of the cd built-in to either
            explicity use the physical path, or allow a path with symlinks, regardless
            of the status of the 'physical' shell option. This allows commands like
            'cd -P l1/..' to be interpreted as expected.

            After the path is interpreted by cd, 'pwd -P' is used to determine the
            physical path it refers to, after dereferencing any symlinks. Refer to the
            docs of the phys_dirpath and _shrtn_cwd functions for more details.

          - This function allows the pushd notation '+N' or '-N' to specify a directory
            using its position on the stack. The stack may be shown with the positions
            using 'dirs -v', which may be aliased to 'dv'.

          - The directory stack is also visible as the DIRSTACK array variable. The
            entries other than [0] may be manipulated manually, but pushd and popd must
            be used to add and remove items.

        Builtin commands to interact with the directory stack

          dirs -v
          : print the directory stack as a numbered column

          dirs +N
          : print nth most recent dir (current is +0)

          dirs -N
          : print nth dir from the end (oldest is -0)

          dirs -c
          : clear the list

          pushd dir
          : add dir to dir-stack, cd to it, then run dirs to show the stack

          pushd -n dir
          : only add dir at position +1, don't cd

          pushd
          : exchange top 2 stack dirs; the former +1 dir will be the new CWD

          pushd +N
          : rotate the stack so the Nth dir is on top, then cd to it

          popd (or popd +0)
          : remove CWD from the list and cd to the dir at position +1

          popd +N
          : remove the Nth dir from the stack
