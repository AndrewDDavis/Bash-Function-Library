bind-grep() {

    : "Search readline or stty keybindings

        Usage

          bind-grep [-s] [grep-options] [pattern]
          bind-grep -k <string>

        This function gathers a list of readline keybindings for functions, macros, and
        shell commands, then runs a 'grep' command to filter the list. The list is
        prefiltered to improve readability and remove the numerous 'self-insert' lines.
        Unless using '-k', all command-line arguments are passed to 'grep'. The default
        grep options are '-E' and '-i', to match using ERE patterns in a case-
        insensitive manner. If no pattern is supplied, all entries are matched.

        Options

          -s
          : Print or match against the filtered output of 'stty -a' to show the
            terminal's keybindings rather than Readline's.

          -k
          : Print the bindings to the supplied string. The string is often a single
            character (e.g. 'n'), but may be a sequence (e.g. '^[[5~' for PgUp).

            If the string contains '^[', which represents the escape character, it is
            removed. This allows matching to a sanitized string produced from bind's
            output.

            When using '-k', matching is performed by 'awk', in the same way that
            'grep -iE' would. Unmatched opening brackets and parentheses ('[', '('),
            which would cause an error, are automatically escaped by bind-grep. Other
            regex meta-chars ('\', '^', '$', '.', '|', '*', '+', '?') should be escaped
            with '\' to be matched literally.

            Most characters, including all letters and digits, are regular expressions
            that match themselves. To match literal meta-characters such as '.', '*',
            '(', '[', '|', '{', '^', and '$', they should be quoted by preceding with a
            backslash or enclosing in square brackets, e.g. '\*' or '[.]'. This includes
            the backslash character itself, which is also double printed in bind's
            double-quoted output; thus, to search for bindings on '\', you would use
            -k '\\\\' or -k '[\][\]'.

        Other common queries that can be accomplished using bind:

          - To filter a list of the **readline function-names** without showing their bindings,
            you can use 'bind -l | grep ...'.

          - To filter a list of **readline variables** and print their state, you can use
            'bind -v | grep...'.

          - To query which keys invoke a function, you can use 'bind -q <name>'. The return
            status also indicates whether the function is bound to any keys.

        Examples

          # print bindings that have to do with history or completion
          bind-grep 'hist|comp'

          # print bindings on 'n'
          bind-grep -k n
          # '\\en', '\\e\\C-n', '\\C-x\\C-n', etc.

          # print bindinds to '{'
          bind-grep -k '\{'

          # print all defined terminal bindings
          bind-grep -s -v undef
