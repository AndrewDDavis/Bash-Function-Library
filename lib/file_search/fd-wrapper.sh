    : "Find variant with user-friendly syntax and defaults

    Usage: fd-wrapper [options] [pattern] [path ...]

    This function matches filenames using the fd command, which may actually be called
    fdfind on some systems. The --no-ignore-vcs option is added by default. This
    function recognizes the --tree option (details below), but otherwise operates just
    like calling the fd command directly.

      --tree
      : This option shows the matched files in a tree view. This is done by passing the
        fd output as a null-delimited list to the tree-fromfiles function, which relies
        on the tree command.

    Pattern matching occurs according to the following behaviour:

      - If the path is omitted, the tree under the current directory is searched.
        Symlinks are not followed, unless -L (--follow) is used. Mount points in the
        tree are searched, unless --xdev (--one-file-system) is used.

      - The pattern is interpreted as a regular expression that may match a substring
        of file basenames. The Rust regex engine is used, with syntax similar to
        'grep -E' or POSIX ERE (<https://docs.rs/regex/1.0.0/regex/#syntax>).

          + Use -p (--full-path) to match full paths.

          + Use -F (--fixed-strings) to treat the pattern as a literal string, but
            still match as a substring.

          + Use -g (--glob) for glob pattern matching. This option also disables
            substring matching (exact filenames are matched). If combined with
            --full-path, '**' matches multiple path components.

          + Use --and to add additional patterns which must both match a filename. To
            add alternative (OR) patterns, use syntax like 'abc|def'.

      - Smart-case matching is employed (cases-insensitive for lowercase patterns).

          + Modify this with -s (--case-sensitive) or -i (--ignore-case).

      - By default, fd excludes hidden files (filenames that start with '.'), as well
        as other ignored files noted below.

          + Use -H (--hidden) to show hidden files. Use -I (--no-ignore) to disable all
            ignore files (i.e. show more results). Option -u (--unrestricted) is an
            alias for -HI.

          + By default, fd respects git-ignore files at the directory, repository, and
            global levels: '.gitignore', '.git/info/exclude', and '~/.config/git/ignore'.
            It also respects directory-level files named '.ignore' and '.fdignore', and
            a global ignore file at '~/.config/fd/ignore'.

            Refer to the gitignore manpage for the syntax of those files, which is
            roughly shell globbing that includes the '**' pattern.

          + This function adds the --no-ignore-vcs option to the command line. This
            shows results that would be excluded by the git-ignore files, but still
            respects the fd-specific ones. Use --ignore-vcs to override the function
            default.

          + It's generally useful to create a '~/.config/fd/ignore' file that excludes
            the ignore files themselves, the contents of .git dirs, and other hidden
            files of little interest.

      - The search results may be filtered using these options:

          + -E (--exclude), which takes a glob pattern.

          + -t (--type), which accepts d for dirs, f for files, l for symlinks, x for
            executable files, or e for empty files. E.g. '-te -td' for empty dirs.

          + -e (--extension), to filter by file extension. To match files with no
            extension, use the regex pattern '^[^.]+$'.

          + Time-based options, such as --newer, --older, --changed-within,
            --changed-after, --changed-before, which take a duration (e.g. 10h, 1d,
            35min) or a specific date or time (e.g. YYYY-MM-DD).

          + Other properties such as -S (--size) and -o (--owner) [user][:group].

    The output from fd and tree is colorized using LS_COLORS, and may be modified by
    these options:

      - Use -l (--list-details) to print a detailed listing, like 'ls -l'.

      - Use -0, (--print0) to print a null character between search results, rather
        than a newline.

      - Use --format for custom output.

    Use -x (--exec) command [args...] to execute a command for each result, using
    parallelized search and execution. To execute the command once, with all results
    as arguments, use -X (--exec-batch).

    Examples

      - Match all files in a directory:

        fd -HI . dir/

      - Equivalent to \"find * -name '*.txt'\":

        fd -e .txt

      - Show the disk usage of all Trash, .Trash, and .Trash-1000 folders:

        fd -H '^(\\.)?Trash(-[0-9]+)?' ~/ \\
            -X du -hsc | sort -h
    "

    # bare fd command with 0 args is allowed
    [[ ${1-} == @(-h|--help) ]] &&
        { docsh -TD; return; }

    local fd_cmd
    fd_cmd=( "$( builtin type -P fd )" ) \
        || fd_cmd=( "$( builtin type -P fdfind )" ) \
            || return 9

    fd_cmd+=( --no-ignore-vcs )

    # args to array
    local fd_args
    fd_args=( "$@" )
    shift $#

    # parse args
    # - NB, array_strrepl returns T/F for match, then deletes the element when
    #   called with no replacement string.
    local _tree
    array_strrepl fd_args '--tree' \
        && _tree=1


    if [[ -v _tree ]]
    then
        # pass file list to tree
        tree-fromfiles < <( "${fd_cmd[@]}" --print0 "${fd_args[@]}" )

    else
        # typical fd command
        "${fd_cmd[@]}" "${fd_args[@]}"
    fi
}
