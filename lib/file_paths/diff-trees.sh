    : "Compare filenames between two filesystem trees

    Usage: diff-trees <path1> <path2> [tree-options]

    The \`diff -us\` command is used to compare the output of the tree command applied
    to the specified directory paths. Unique filenames are printed, with 3 lines of
    context above and below. The context may or may not include the ascii representation
    of all containing directories for the unique files.

    See also diff-filenames.
