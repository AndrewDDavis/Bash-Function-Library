        Usage: tree-match [options] [pattern] [--] [dir1] ...

        The tree command is used to match files and directories under the specified
        root paths ('.' by default). This function uses the --filesfirst option, so
        that files are listed before directories. Otherwise, it operates just like
        calling the tree command directly, unless the command-line includes a pattern.

        If no pattern is passed, all files and directories are printed, subject to the
        settings of -a and --gitignore. The pattern matching occurs as follows:

          - The pattern is passed to tree using the -P option, which has syntax similar
            to shell globbing using the extglob option. This allows alternative patterns
            to be matched using '|'.

          - Directories are matched, as well as filenames (--matchdirs). A pattern
            ending in '/' matches only directories.

          - Directories that don't match the pattern, and don't contain matching files,
            are omitted from the listing (--prune).

          - The matching is case insensitive (--ignore-case).

          - If further -P options are issued, files that match any of the patterns are
            printed.

          - Contrary to what might be expected from the manpage, the '**/' pattern
            should not be used with tree -P or -I. The patterns should be simple
            basename-matching patterns, and not include any '/' except possibly as the
            last character, to match directories. This is per the response from the dev
            on my [bug report](https://github.com/Old-Man-Programmer/tree/issues/17).

            Another minor inconcistency: when a directory is matched directly, e.g.
            because it resides in the search root, or the pattern starts with '**/',
            its contents are listed. Otherwise, only the directory name is printed.

        Other notable tree options (refer to the tree manpage for a full list):

          -a
          : match hidden files, like 'ls -A'. Without this, no hidden files are matched,
            even with a pattern like '.*'. When this option is passed, tree-match adds
            the arguments -I '.git/' to exclude git directories and their contents.

          -d
          : print only directories

          -D
          : print dates

          -l
          : follow symbolic links if they point to directories

          -L
          : max depth of tree listing (search root = 1)

          -I <pat>
          : exclude files matching pattern. A match to -I trumps a match to -P.

          --noreport
          : omit the file and directory report at the end of the listing
