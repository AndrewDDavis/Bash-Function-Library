        The output differs depending on the context, whether run for the return of
        a function, a sourced file, or a command.

        Usage

        _Case 1_: in the main lines of an interactive shell.

          trap 'trap-err \$?' ERR

          # Consider also something like this. This way, functions will return
          # immediately and print an error when a command returns with non-zero status.
          # However, the test ensures that the ERR trap won't trigger in the interactive
          # shell. Except it does in completion functions, it would be nice if it didn't
          # do that.
          set -o errtrace
          trap '
              [[ -v FUNCNAME[0] ]] && {
                  echo \"traperr from \${FUNCNAME[0]}()\"
                  return
              }
          ' ERR

        _Case 2_: in a function, or used with functrace from an interactive shell.

          # - To prevent the ERR trap 'leaking' into the enclosing shell, set both
          #   an ERR and a RETURN trap (see below).
          # - Using a naked return command in the ERR trap preserves the return status
          #   of the triggering command.

          foo() {
              trap '
                  trap-err \$?
                  return
              ' ERR

              trap '
                  trap - ERR RETURN
                  # also maybe unset -f ...
              ' RETURN
              ...

              # If there are sub-functions, you probably want 'errtrace' but not
              # 'functrace', so that the subfunctions will return immediately and print
              # an error when a command returns with non-zero status, but also

              # extend traps to sub-functions
              shopt -os errtrace    # functions inherit the ERR trap
              #shopt -os functrace   # functions inherit RETURN and DEBUG traps
          }

        Notes and Gotchas

        - Using a naked 'return' call in the ERR trap preserves the return status of the
          command that triggered the trap.

        - Calling 'exit' within an EXIT trap is a special case that skips a recursive
          run of the trap. If it's a naked 'exit' call, the return status is the value
          on entry to the trap.
          ref: [QA](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/667384/85414)

        - Process substitution, like '<( cmd ... )', runs asynchronously, so \$? is not
          set to the return status of 'cmd'. That makes debugging harder. You can
          use a fifo or some [clever tricks](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/176703/85414),
          but finding a different way is ideal if the command could fail.

        - Another item to watch for: if you use a subshell during inline initialization
          of a varaible when using 'local' or 'declare' (e.g. \`local foo=\$( cmd ... )\`),
          the return status of the subshell is lost; the local command returns 0
          regardless. So only use inline init with local for very simple cases.
