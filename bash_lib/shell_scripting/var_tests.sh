# This file contains assertion test functions for shell variables. See also
# arrayvar_tests.sh, which contains tests that are specific to array variables.

# Testing notes:
#
# - A variable is "set" if it has been assigned any value, including NUL. Variables may
#   be declared and given attributes, but still be considered "unset". E.g., after
#   declaring an integer variable with 'declare -i i', or a local variable with
#   'local abc', the variables are still unset.
#
#   However, the attributes of such a variable may be queried using ${abc@a}, or by
#   parsing the output of ${abc@A} or 'declare -p abc'.
#
# - When a variable is a nameref, ${abc[*]@A} prints the attributes of the underlying
#   variable, whereas 'declare -p abc' prints the nameref declaration. To print the
#   attributes of the underlying variable using declare, use 'declare -p "${!abc}"'.

    # NB, the simpler [[ -n ${var[*]} ]] test is usually adequate.
    # But it fails for an edge case in which an array with multiple elements, all of
    # which are NUL, would give a true result. The reason is that the nulls would be
    # joined by the first element of IFS.
    # So, you could use a subshell and temporarily set IFS, or otherwise capture it:
    #    ( IFS=''; test "${__avt_arrnm__[*]}"; )
    # A loop can also be used to test elements individually, and this took ~ 20 ms for
    # 1000 iterations, versus ~ 900 ms for the subshell. The '-' is needed in param
    # to ensure test is run with a null arg for unset vars.
