time-reps() {

	: "Time repetitions of a command

		Usage: time-reps [options] command [args ...]

		Records the time it takes to runs the provided command-line repeatedly 1000
		times (n), then repeats the timed loop a total of 10 times (m). The stdout of
		the command is diverted to /dev/null, to prevent the time of printing to the
		terminal from influencing the results. Only the 'real' time is reported, unless
		only 1 meta-loop is requested.

		For reference purposes, running 1000 iterations of a no-op command typically
		takes ~2 ms on my machine. A very simple builtin command such as 'echo hi'
		may take ~3 ms, while a simple external call such as '/bin/echo hi' may take
		~1100 ms. This implies ~3 us for 1 run of a very simple builtin command, or
		~1 ms for 1 call of an external commmand. Often the first meta-iteration
		takes longer than the next ones, but not always. Using the meta-loop gives
		more consistent, faster results, compared to repeatedly running the timed
		loop in an interactive terminal session.

		Simple commands work well as input. To test more complex command lines, e.g.
		with redirections, it is necessary to wrap the commands in a function, then
		pass the function call as the command to time-reps. This adds a small amount of
		overhead (~4 ms to run a no-op or simple builtin 1000 times via a function).

		Options

			-n N
			: number of repetitions of the command on the inner loop (default 1000)

			-m M
			: meta-repetitions of the loop (default 10)

		Examples

		  time-nits echo hi
