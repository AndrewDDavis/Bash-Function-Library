    : """Wrapper function for rsync with useful modes

        Usage: rsyncx [rsync-opts] SRC [... DEST]

        This wrapper function runs rsync with a set of options that are sensible in most
        situations, and provides a few additional options for common situations.
        Otherwise, this function passes all of its arguments unchanged to rsync. Rsync
        requires that remote source or destination names include a colon, as in
        [user@]host:dir. If DEST is omitted, the contents of SRC are listed.

        By default, rsyncx adds the flags -rlpt and -AXU to the command-line. These are
        a sensible starting point for almost any transfer. However, they can be
        selectively negated, like all other options, by using e.g. --no-t. The -N
        (--crtimes) option is not issued, since it's not available with Debian-compiled
        rsync at the time of writing.

        Beyond -rlpt, the remaining flags turned on by 'rsync -a' are -goD. Rsyncx only
        adds these to the command when all SRC and DEST are local. In practice, these
        flags are ignored by rsync anyway (partially for -g) unless running as super-
        user on the receiving end, or using --super.

        While rsync only detects whether any SRC or DEST are remote by matching the
        required colon in the name, rsyncx additionally detects locally-mounted remote
        filesystems using SSHfs, rclone, or gvfs (e.g. GIO vfs mounts created by
        Nautilus). This avoids permissions errors for such transfers, as rsync would
        try and fail to apply -g.

        In addition, rsyncx applies either the --local or --remote flag based on the
        auto-detection of remote SRC and DEST, unless one is explicitly included on the
        command-line. These are described below, along with the additional flags that
        rsyncx makes available.

          --local
          : This adds -H to the defaults, to preserve hard-links.

          --remote
          : Adds -z and --partial to the defaults. This compresses data in transit, and
            preserves partially transferred files. NB, rsync has a good default list of
            compression exclusions. The --info=progress2 option is also added to show
            overall transfer progress.

          --remote-mount
          : Some of the --remote options can also be useful when transferring to or from
            local directories that are actually a remote filesystem mount, such as
            through SSHfs. This flag sets the --partial and --info=progress2 flags, and
            prevents -goD from being added, to avoid permissions errors. When neither
            of the --local or --remote flags are used, rsyncx will attempt to detect
            a remote mount and set --remote-mount automatically.

          --diff
          : Check for differences among files, but don't make any transfers. In addition
            to the defaults, this adds: -nci --delete. Refer to the notes on -i below:
            any files that are only on DEST will be marked with *deleting, and any files
            that are only on SRC will be marked with xx+++++++++.

          --rsbak
          : Create backup files, using the options: --backup --suffix='.rsbak'. Consider
            also the --backup-dir option.

          --mv
          : Simulate moving files. This adds --remove-source-files, and --info=remove to
            print an info line for each removed file. After a successful transfer, the
            source files are removed, but empty directories may remain. This can depend
            on interactions with filters, etc, thus pruning empty directories is not
            attempted. Suggested commands to prune the dirs are printed.

        Info Reporting Options

        By default, rsync is quiet. To show some basic info including a listing of
        changed files, -v can be used to turn on a sensible set of --info flags. Using
        -vv shows very detailed information about the transfer and the application of
        the filter rules.

        This function adds --info=del,stats to the command-line when -v is not used.
        This prints file deletions and a short data transfer summary. -h is also added
        for human readable data units.

        Use -i to print a summary line for each changed file. Using -ii also prints a
        line for unchanged files. Refer to the rsync manpage under --itemize-changes to
        decode the summary line. Briefly:

          - If a file is to be removed, the summary line is * followed by the
            word deleting. Otherwise, the first char is the update type. It may be < or
            > for files sent and received, . for a file with unchanged content, or c for
            a directory to be created.

          - The second char is the file type, which may be f, d, L, D, or S.

          - The remaining characters are + for a newly created file. Otherwise, any that
            are not . indicate what will be updated, or why the file is being
            transferred, e.g. c for checksum, s for size, t for time, etc.

        Issue '--info=help' to print the rsync's info flag options that may be used. The
        following options are recommended to achieve the noted effects. Note that
        explicit --info settings always override the implied settings of e.g. -v or
        --progress:

          --info=name0
          : Suppress the file listing when using -v or -vv.

          --info=name2 or -vv
          : Print a line for each unchanged file.

          --info=skip or -vv
          : Print a line for each skipped file when using -u (--update).

          --info=progress2
          : Show overall transfer progress (added with --remote)

          --stats or --info=stats2
          : Print a detailed file transfer summary.

          --debug=filter or -vv
          : Print the results of applied filter rules.

        Thus, adding -ni to your existing command line is an excellent way to get a
        detailed picture of the changes that will occur, before affecting any files. If
        using -nii with -u, rsyncx also adds --info=skip to get a complete picture.

        Filter Rules

        Rsync builds an ordered list of filter rules as specified on the command-line
        and found in relevant files. The default is for all files within the transfer
        root to be included.

        This function honours the filter rules found in '~/.config/rsync/default.rules',
        if that file exists. They are applied using the merge-files syntax for the
        '--filter' option, and are intended to exclude machine-specific hidden files,
        such as '.DS_Store' and lock files. To clear the filter list, use: -f'!' on the
        command line.

        To exclude files for a single transfer, the --exclude=PATTERN option may be
        used, which is equivalent to a filter rule of -f'- PATTERN'. The patterns
        generally follow globbing rules as in other similar tools. Refer to the PATTERN
        MATCHING RULES section of the rsync manpage for details and examples.

        To include only certain files in a transfer, include rules are needed for the
        file and any parent directories within the transfer root. Then a trailing
        exclusion rule that matches all files would be specified, e.g.:

          -f'+ x/' -f'+ x/y/' -f'+ x/y/file.txt' -f'- *' x host:/tmp/

        Exclude rules both hide files on the sending side and protect files on the
        receiving side. Similarly, include rules both show (or expose) files on the
        sending side, and risk files on the receiving side.

        The option -F may be used apply per-directory filter rules found in files
        named '.rsync-filter'. With -F, the .rsync-filter files may be found in parent
        directories of the transfer root, as well as its subdirectories. Refer to the
        MERGE-FILE FILTER RULES section of the rsync manpage.
