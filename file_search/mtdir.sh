    : "Test for an empty directory

    Usage: mtdir [-P] <path>

    The \`find\` command is used to examine the file path, and mtdir returns with
    status code 0 (success) if the path represents an empty directory. mtdir returns
    with status 1 if the path is a non-empty directory, if it is not a directory, if
    the path does not exist, or if there are insufficient permissions to check whether
    a directory is empty. In the latter two cases, an error is printed by \`find\`.

    If the path is a symlink, mtdir follows it to evaluate the file it points to.
    To disable this behaviour and cause symlinks to produce a failed test, add the
    '-P' option before the path.
